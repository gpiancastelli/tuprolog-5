tuProlog-5 is a rewriting exercise: a port of tuProlog's code from Java 1.4 to
Java 5/6. In the process, occasional reorganization and bug fixing may happen,
whenever I feel it as the appropriate thing to do. There is no plan to add new
features.

This is just a personal programming exercise, useful to help myself learning
the "new" features of Java 5 by putting them in practice on a familiar code
base. Nonetheless the repository is public, because this porting effort could
be interesting for others, too.

tuProlog-5 starts from the source code of tuProlog 2.1.1. This is the last
version I helped releasing, so it is the one I know better. A proper change
log will be filled on the project wiki hosted by Github:

tuProlog-5 is not in any way endorsed by tuProlog's development team or
related to tuProlog's main development line. Bug reports, feature requests,
&c. regarding tuProlog must be sent to SourceForge:
